# Python scripts

Just a dump of random Python scripts I made.
For questions, ask in the Discord: https://discord.gg/ZMRKy8n
Check the scripts for any configs or file dependancies.

# dchk
A script that scans all files in a directory of a certain time for a certain string.
Run in commandline as  python3 dchk.py "path/to/check/" .file_ext_to_check string_to_check

# sTimer
A WIP for a timer application, don't work properly.

# sNotes
A GUI note-taking app. Saves to noteruntime.txt in the same directory.

# sDiceRoll
A simple GUI tool for rolling a dice.

# sCalc
A basic calculator, uses string based calculations, e.i. 2*5+2

# PythenaDiscord
Script for the Athena discord bot, can not be run on its own, requires you to have a Discord developer app set up, and a token string.

# pyLogBackup
A tool for backing up the DX log. Instructions are in the script for what each variable does.
Used for the server starter script.

# DXServer
A Python based server starter. If running on Linux, make sure bUnixMode in the script is True, else False.
Other variables in the script are self-explanatory, edit as required.

# DXMI
Scans the directory as set in "dlpath" in the script, and moves them to the correct directories in the game. GamePath should be the root of your game, e.i. C:/Deus Ex/
